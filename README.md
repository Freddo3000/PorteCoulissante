# PorteCoulissante

PorteCoulissante is a Minecraft plugin made for the Spigot API adding portcullises, originally made by pepjin.  
Old source code is available [on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/portecoulissant/).  
Old [dev.bukkit page](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/portecoulissante).

## Installation

1. Place the most recent released .jar file into your servers /plugins folder.
2. Launch the server once to generate the config.yml located in /plugins/PorteCoulissante
3. Close the server and change the aforementioned config.yml file to suit your needs
4. Restart server and check that the plugin is functional

## Usage

* Build the portcullis itself by stacking rows of fences (wood or iron), at least two wide and two high. 
* Build the wall around it to contain it. Leave enough empty space above the portcullis to allow it to go as high as you want it to go. 
* Power the portcullis by powering one of the blocks adjacent to it on either side, by attaching a lever or redstone dust. For now, the power has to come from the side. 
* When the block is powered, the portcullis will start moving upwards, and will keep going until it hits something and can't go any further. It moves slowly, since a portcullis is heavy! 
* __Important:__ make sure that when it is in the up position, it is still in contact with a powered block (the same one, or a different one). 
* When the power goes off, the portcullis will drop down (a lot faster than it went up).
